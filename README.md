1)Add 4 different products:
First, we will need to create a component for each product that includes a description and a button to add the product to the cart. We can use the useState hook to manage the state of each product and display the relevant information on the page.
2)We can then create an array of products and use the map function to render a list of Product components.
3)Add to cart and delete from cart:
To add a product to the cart, We can create a cart component that keeps track of the products in the cart and displays them on the page. We can use the useState hook to manage the state of the cart and update it when a product is added or removed.
To delete a product from the cart, We can add a button to the Product component that calls the handleRemoveFromCart function when clicked.
